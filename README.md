# Learning-Log
Learning Log is a website designed to track the topics that a user has learned.

This project was written using python and django on a linux operating system, after completing the website, i used an Heroku server 
to deploy it on https://learning-log-24.herokuapp.com.

I found the idea of this project in "Python Crash Course", a book by Eric Matthes, and i wrote it using said book.

The idea for the website is very basic, each user can create topics and add different entries to them.
